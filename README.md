# CleverSDK

Fully Implements the Clever API in a simple to use SDK in Ruby


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'clever_sdk'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install clever_sdk

Be sure to define your Clever credentials by setting up environment variables in your application appropriately. Refer to the .env.sample file for details.
```
CLEVER_ID =     'my-clever-id'
CLEVER_SECRET = 'my-clever-key'
```


## Usage

There are many primary APIs that are wrapped. Below you will see basic examples of how to use them. For more information about what optional query parameters are available, please consult the [Clever API Docs](https://dev.clever.com/docs)

## Configuration

Place the following configuration in your apps initializer


```ruby
CleverSDK.configure do |config|
  config.clever_id     = "your-value"
  config.clever_secret = "your-value"
  config.redirect_uri  = "your-value"  
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
